Block: This property is used as the default property of div. This property places the div one after another vertically. The height and width of the div can be changed using the block property if the width is not mentioned, then the div under the block property will take up the width of the container.


Output: 
display block property
Inline: This property is the default property of anchor tags. This is used to place the div inline i.e. in a horizontal manner. The inline display property ignores the height and the width set by the user. 


Output: 
display inline property
Inline-block: This features uses the both properties mentioned above, block and inline. So, this property aligns the div inline but the difference is it can edit the height and the width of block. Basically, this will align the div both in block and inline fashion.

Output: 
display inline block
None: This property hides the div or the container which use this property. Using it on one of the div it will make working clear.
