    <p>Dear Mr. Sandler</p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><b>JOB APPLICATION LETTER</b></h3>
    <P>
        I am writing to express my interest in the position of marketing associate for Carter Snack Company. Your sales associate Nick Caudwell referred me to this opportunity. I believe that my five years of experience in food and drink marketing make me an excellent fit for this job opening.
    </P>
    <p>
        In my current position at Fizz Soda Company, I spearheaded several successful campaigns for new drink products. My aptitude for market analysis helped me identify key demographics to target these marketing efforts. I believe that I could bring this level of success to Carter Snack Company and help your upcoming summer snack food campaigns reach a fresh audience. I see great potential in marketing to a younger demographic with your snack cakes and would love to discuss the possibilities with you.
    </p>

        I have PCM Digital Marketing Certification, Hootsuite Social Marketing Certification and Google Analytics Individual certification. I am also a Facebook Certified Planning Professional.
